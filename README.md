# Palabos

[Palabos](https://palabos.unige.ch/) is an open-source CFD solver based on the [lattice Boltzmann method](https://palabos.unige.ch/lattice-boltzmann/what-lattice-boltzmann/). 
From this page, you can download and run MuTech's first Palabos example, which was based on Marlon's thesis case. This is under examples/showCases/jordiPowerFlowCopy.

# Installation

Palabos is very easy to install since it does not depend on any external dependencies.

## Linux Prerequisites

The mandatory packages are the following:

- A modern C++ compiler `gcc` or `clang`
- `clang-format` version 14
- `make`
- `cmake`




## Linux optional prerequisites

The optional but recommended packages are the following:

- [openmpi](https://www.open-mpi.org/), by default all the examples use MPI.
- [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), some examples output `.gif` which are generated by calling `convert`.
- [hdf5](https://www.hdfgroup.org) for the use of hdf5 output.
- [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) to speed up the compilation process.


**Linux**

As stated in the user guide, run the preprocessing python codes on UnderstandingGridRefinement.
```
$ cd palabos/examples/showCases/jordiPowerFlowCopy/build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ ./jordiPowerFlowCopy config.xml
```

If you have a functioning MPI installation you can run it on 4 cores for example
using the command

```
$ mpirun -np 4 ./jordiPowerFlowCopy config.xml
```
